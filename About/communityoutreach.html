	<div>
		<h2>Community Outreach</h2>
		<p>The HOT Team is very active in the community. We participate in many community service projects, conduct robotics presentations, promote science and technology in our hometowns, are very involved in FLL and work to make our community a nicer and more fun place by volunteering for clean up programs and athletic events.</p>

		<h3>Seminar</h3>
		<p>Team 67 members have begun to work with special needs students at both high schools. The team has been teaching aspects of robotics and general engineering. Students and team members use the VEX robot kit.  Circuit building has been a particularly engaging activity. Through this outreach, the team has been able include students who otherwise would not have access to robotic conversations and building. This has proved to be so popular that non-special needs students have often joinied the group build sessions.</p>

		<h3>Buddy Break</h3>
		<p>
		Buddy Break is a community outreach program located at a local church in 
		White Lake. Hot team members regularly attend to special needs

		<h3>Milford Memories</h3>
		<p>The HOT Team sets up an activity tent at Milford Memories, an outdoor festival where vendors from all over Michigan bring their tents full of merchandise to appeal to customers. The HOT team’s acitivty tent includes activity packets, face painting, a button designing table, and tables full of Legos where kids can build whatever they want, including vehicles to race down a ramp.
		Our tent also includes an area where Vex robots are available to drive, as well as the chance for kids to drive CASEY, our community service robot. CASEY also has the ability to inflate balloons, which our team members then bend into animals or other objects for kids to enjoy. Also on display is the competition bot that we had built and used this year. We usually perform some demonstrations to showcase the robot’s capabilities in order to interest new members and entertain spectators.</p>

Our team rendezvous at the Sunrise Christian Fellowship Church across from the Y.M.C.A. on Commerce Road, and then walks along the road picking up trash until we reach the end of our segment at North Gardner. Generally, our team spilts up into two groups, each covering one side of the road.</p>
